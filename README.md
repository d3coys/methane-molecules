For the unit 5 assignment, you will utilize many of the capabilities that we have already learned within the course to create, using geometry, lighting, color, transformation, and the other aspects of the 3D graphics environment, a model of the Methane molecule. The methane molecule is comprised of 5 atoms, including 1 carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms.

Your model should look like the figure above and be constructed using sphere objects for the atoms and cylinders or tubes to represent the bonds. The cylinders should be perpendicular to the sphere's surface and at the center of them. Use any blue color tone for the hydrogen atoms, any red color tone for the carbon atom, and the bonds should be white with light gray for the emissive.

You must enable animation for your model, and mouse controls should be enabled so that your program's user can rotate the molecule in any direction.

You must also add a green-colored plane object to your scene. The plane object provides a flat surface under the object that can both reflect light and show the shadows created by the object's position interacting with the light source. Make sure that only YOUR OBJECT moves and not the plane.

Note:

It is essential to document your code liberally with comments to ensure that a reviewer understands what you were attempting to do within the assignment.

When you have completed the assignment, you must click on the share button and copy both the “Graphics View” (Live and full preview) and the “Code View” URLs and then submit with your assignment. You can also submit your JavaScript code, but you should only cut and paste the code into the submission dialogue box. Do not attach the source code document. Your assignment is due at the end of this unit. 

Grading Criteria

Are the objects the correct colors (red, blue, white, and green)? (Yes/No)

Does the assignment display a plane in the scene? (Yes/No)

Are the cylinders perpendicular to the sphere's surface and at the center of them? (Yes/No)

Does the object within the assignment generate shadows on the plane's surface as it interacts with the lighting source? (Yes/No)

Are mouse controls enabled so that the molecule object can be rotated in both x and y directions by the user? (Yes/No)

Do the mouse controls move only the object and not the plane or lighting sources? (Yes/No)

Was the javascript / Three.js code well documented (Scale of 1-4 where 1 is no comments and 4 is comprehensive comments)
